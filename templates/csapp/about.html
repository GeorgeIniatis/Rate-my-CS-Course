    <h2 class="text-center my-4"> About Us </h2>
	<p>
        We are a small group of Computing Science students who think that short course descriptions are rarely enough for making an informed decision about which subjects to take.
        We want to be able to hear what current UofG students in Computing Science have to say about their courses, in order to provide us and every other UofG Computing Science 
        student (or a student-to-be) with a more useful guide on choosing our courses for the following year. We came up with the idea to give students a platform where they
        could freely express how they feel about their courses and rate them in order to help others choose. Current students are able to rate their courses based on: 
	</p>
	<ul class="customList">
		<li>their overall satisfaction with the course;</li>
		<li>their satisfaction with the lecturer;</li>
		<li>how engaging the course is;</li>
		<li>how informative the course is;</li>
		<li>(optionally) leave comments about the course.</li>
	</ul>  	
    <h2> Rate a CS course</h2>
    <p> If you are a current Computing Science student at University of Glasgow you can rate (and review) the CS courses you have taken. 
    Your rating will help determine the average rating for the course, which is displayed on the course information page. 
    Your review will also appear under <strong>Latest Reviews</strong> on the relevant course page.</p><br>
    <p><strong>To rate a course:</strong></p>
    <ul class="customList">
		<li>Log into your account. If you don't have an account, sign up and select the courses you have taken.
        <p class="text-muted">You can select courses that you are currently taking and courses you have taken in previous years(if applicable).</p></li>
		<li>Browse the Undergraduate/Postgraduate courses pages and find the course you want to rate. You can also use the search bar to search for a specific course.
        <p class="text-muted">Note that you have access to all courses but can only rate courses that you have taken.</p></li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Leave Review</strong> button.</li>
		<li>Give your rating by selecting a number of stars for each of the categories listed above.</li>
		<li>You can optionally leave a comment(review) about the course.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong></li>
        <li>When submitted, your review will appear on the <strong>Reviews</strong> page.</li> 
        <li>You can <strong>Edit/Delete</strong> your review at any given time either from the <strong>Reviews</strong> page or from the relevant 
        course page by repeating the steps above.</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Why create an account?</h2>
    <p> As a non-registered user you will have access to the different courses pages. Every course has a short description,
    average ratings and a section with the latest reviews.</p>
    <p> As a registered user you will able to access additional information such as information about the 
    <strong>Open days</strong> - useful for future UofG Computing Science students. You will have access to an additional section <strong>Need Help?</strong> on every course page ,
    in which relevant contact information will be displayed:</p>
    <ul class="customList">
    <li>If any of the students who have taken the course has agreed their contact information to be visible,
    it will appear on the course page under this section. You can choose to email them if you happen to have questions about the course.</li>
    <li>If there are no registered students that have taken this course or they have not agreed their contact information to be visible on the course page,
    the section will still provide information on who you can turn to with any additional queries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a registered user who is also a current UofG Computing Science student, you will be able to also review the courses that you have taken.</p>
